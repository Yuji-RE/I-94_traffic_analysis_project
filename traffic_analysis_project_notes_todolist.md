## TO DO LIST

- [ ] make plots for `scattered clouds`, `haze` and `mist` to find if there's any patterns for the frequency of the target weather occurance, utilizing ACF as well. [reference](https://chatgpt.com/share/692cefd7-5b48-8013-8609-ae07651b339e)

-  [ ] rewrite the col:1226 md cell and decide what to do with the `plot_traffic_pattern` function, wheather to comment out it or use it still, but with docstring explaning why you made it, because at this rate, it doesn’t align with my initial objective, which was to make it to see the climate occurance patterns, since it includes avg traffic volume which blurs it.

- [ ] assure that every titles and rabels of graphs are accurately describing its data.
Especially, the misconception of `weakday` and `weakend`.
e.g; col:543 code cell <- there's no legend for weakend.

- [ ] assure that every time I quoted cell numbers, it's refering to the correct one, by restarting kernel and running all cells to confirm weather it's correct or not.

- [x] create 'oil' option for starter dashboard.

- [ ] set hl for render-markdown.nvim Quote - I'd like it to be moss green.
